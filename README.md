# todomvc-expanded
Expanded todomvc with login, signup and drag and drop

Simple todoMVC app build with Vue.js, originally forked from [testing-workshop-cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress). I expanded the appliaction and added a couple of features.

## Start up instructions

1. Clone the repo
2. cd into testing-lists
3. run `npm i`
4. run `npm start`
5. Go to localhost:3000 to ensure application is running
6. open a new terminal 
7. cd into testing-lists folder
8. run `npx cypress open`
9. Look at the BDD scenarios in the .feature files within the cypress folder
10. Go to the corresponding spec.js file and write the test definitions for the scenarios

## Features
### drag & drop
Reorder todos in list.
TBD: make sure the reorder keeps itâ€™s state after refresh ðŸ™‚

### signup page
Signup page with ability to send a real welcome email. Using [sendmail](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sendmail) to do that. Signups are stored in data.json, in plain text. So, yeah.

### login page
Works with previously signed up emails. Server returns an auth cookie in form of auth=true, LOL ðŸ˜†

## api
Backend is a json-server on a static json file. Middleware handles couple of cases. Some of these are:

### POST /reset
Deletes all todos and all accounts, that were created on signup page.

### DELETE /todos
Deletes all todos

### DELETE /accounts
Deletes all accounts, created on signup page

## Installation
1. `npm i`
2. `npm start`

App runs on localhost:3000 by default.
